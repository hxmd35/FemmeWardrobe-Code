    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        My project is about creating an online shopping fashion site named Femme Wardrobe. To make it a professional and accessible platform, I purchased a domain name with Namecheap Website since it has affordable rates, good service, and easy user interface that makes domain management easy. Once I bought the domain, I connected it to my site with the help of Amazon Web Services (AWS). I chose AWS as it offers a safe, scalable, and high-performance hosting platform that ensures my site is running efficiently and is available whenever I need it. I hosted the site on an AWS EC2 instance and connected the domain with its public IP address so that users all over the world could access the site effectively.
The main objective of this project is to develop a modern and convenient online shopping platform where everyone can purchase stylish outfits at the comfort of their homes. My goal is to establish a platform that would make online shopping easy, fun, and comfortable, allowing users to browse collections, add items to their cart, and place orders without going to physical stores. I will create the site on WordPress since it is flexible, scalable, and open source, which is ideal in e-commerce projects. Using WordPress, I will add some of the most important features such as secure checkout, multiple payment methods, product catalogue, order tracking, and personalized product suggestions. The site will also have a Wishlist option and will be fully responsive, making it compatible in desktops, tablets, and mobile devices to have a smooth shopping experience.
